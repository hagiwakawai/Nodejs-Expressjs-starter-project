# Simple Node.js and Express.js Server
A project to learn for my internship 

# This is a simple Node.js and Express.js server project for learning the basics of backend development. It includes two main routes:

/test: A basic route that returns ok: true.   
/greet/:name: A dynamic route that greets the user with the value they provide after the slash, e.g., /greet/Gen returns Hello, Gen!!.  

# The project covers:

Setting up a Node.js server with Express.  
Creating dynamic routes.  
Organizing code into modules for better scalability.  
Learning basic version control with Git.
